### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - My master's degree: scrapping Linkedin data from a small community and analyzing that data
  - My daily work at Seazone, where I work as a Data Scientist. I don't do any scrapping there, instead I focus on ETL, Data Analysis and building ML models.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - enough material to get my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification
  - Computer Networking (using Jim Kurose's book and his free lectures, exercises: http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/lectures.php)
  - Some more advanced algorithms and data structures on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/andrejpadilha/).
